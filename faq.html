<li><strong>How could I improve my fax quality?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If possible, please change the fonts of fax documents to be dark and the background to be white when creating fax. While scanning a fax, you need to properly focus on the camenra so that text will be crisp. Moreover, taking a photo in a bright room without the impact of other lights will help your fax more clarity. These tricks only work with fax text documents, not photos and pictures.</p>
