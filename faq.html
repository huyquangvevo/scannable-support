<li><strong>How could I improve my document quality?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If possible, please change the fonts of documents to be dark and the background to be white when creating document. While scanning a document, you need to properly focus on the camenra so that text will be crisp. Moreover, taking a photo in a bright room without the impact of other lights will help your document more clarity. These tricks only work with text documents, not photos and pictures.</p>
